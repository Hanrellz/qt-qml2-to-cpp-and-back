qt-qml2-to-cpp-and-back
=======================

Simple example of integrating QML2 and C++.

See the blog post for a walkthough: http://andrew-jones.com/blog/qml2-to-c-and-back-again/

A slightly more complicated way to do this, using [signals and slots](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/signalsandslots.html), can be found in [andrewrjones/qml2-to-cpp-and-back-signals](/andrewrjones/qml2-to-cpp-and-back-signals).
